## ðŸ‘¥ What is this project?
This project is a Node.js application that automates following and unfollowing users on GitHub at random intervals, simulating human-like behavior. It uses a queue system to manage actions, integrates logging for tracking activity, and includes a Discord webhook feature for real-time notifications of follow and unfollow events. The app ensures compliance with GitHubâ€™s API rate limits and helps boost your profile growth, presence, and interactions by automatically engaging with users. Designed for long-term, 24/7 operation, it efficiently handles large volumes of users by optimizing API calls and minimizing redundant actions, ensuring smooth and resource-effective performance.
